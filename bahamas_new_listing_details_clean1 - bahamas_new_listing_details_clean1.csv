This phenomenal 1.3 acre Estate lot offers 200 feet of golf frontage with the bay and beach just beyond. The Abaco Club on Winding Bays golf course has been rated the #1 course in the Bahamas since its inception in 2004. While the golf is exceptional, the pristine 2 mile white sand beach and the shallow tranquil waters of Winding Bay are simply divine.

ABOUT THE ABACO CLUB

Dramatically perched 65 feet from sea level and surrounded by the boundless natural beauty of its own private Bahamian peninsula, The Abaco Club is the perfect antidote for modern-day life. The Club was created to fulfill a vision - that of an international sporting club that would transcend anything the world has ever seen. Today, under the new guidance of Southworth Development, The Club is entering a new phase. One in which residents, club members and guests will see dreams come true on a daily basis, while they enjoy an array of world-class leisure amenities like the infinity edge pool, day dock, tennis courts, sailing, snorkeling, kayaking, windsurfing, bocce, volleyball and a Scottish-style links golf course that has been perennially ranked as the finest course in the Bahamas. A world-class golf practice facility and a stunning new marina are just some of the new amenities under way as part of the multi-million dollar makeover. Diving, bone fishing and deep-sea fishing are also popular activities. Located only 170 miles east of Palm Beach, FL, The Abaco Club is a pristine, 534-acre retreat that offers the pleasures of graceful island living to a discerning few.

The Abaco Club spreads graciously over almost 600 acres of spectacular peninsula, with over two miles of white sand beaches and natural dunes. Sweeping panoramic views can be enjoyed from The Cliff House, where a private dining room overlooks the tropical hues of the ocean, 18th green and Winding Bay. Whether enjoying a soothing massage at the exclusive Spa, a game of tennis, or simply relaxing poolside overlooking the sparkling turquoise waters of Winding Bay, each day invites new ways to experience the luxuries of total escape.

Traveling to The Abaco Club:

Traveling to the Abaco Club could not be easier. Abacos largest airport, Marsh Harbour International (MHH), has numerous non-stop daily flights from Florida, Georgia (Atlanta) and Nassau and caters to all private jet traffic.

About Abaco:

While the clubs privacy and seclusion will comfort members and guests, the club is as accessible as it is picturesque. Marsh Harbour, just 20 minutes from the club, is the third largest city in the Bahamas and has a year round population of 10,000 residents. Marsh Harbour is a safe, clean and lovely town that features a host of charming shops, delightful restaurants, large modern grocery stores, full service marinas and excellent medical facilities. Abaco is protected by over 90 miles of colourful individual cays and it is known as the fishing and boating capital of the Bahamas.",F1409880634,AS13040,,,Land,,"['Island', 'Tennis Court', 'View', 'Cable', 'Security', 'Concierge']","LOT DESCRIPTION

Separated from Eleuthera by a bridge with security gate, all residents are assured a peaceful lifestyle in this idyllic Paradise. The private members' club offers tennis courts, a heated swimming pool, fitness room and beach access by day and is the gathering spot for cocktails and dining in the evenings. A magnificent pink sand beach with barely a footprint is accessible via a 100' access reserved for residents. Start the day with a sunrise beach walk, ride a wave or just immerse yourself in the warmth of the sun, caress of the ocean breeze and rhythmic sounds of the sea upon the sand. The leeward side of the island overlooks the tranquility of Savannah Sound, a perfect spot for family fun on the water. It is here that lot 86, covering .51 of an acre with 116' of waterfront, witnesses the sunset splendour. House plans available!

The property is 16,692 square feet, or 0.383 acres and located right on the main road for easy access. It is also located directly on a water access right of way giving you everything you will need in a lot. Due to the great elevation of the lot it is likely that the home built there will have views of the sea and the northern lagoon.

Norman's Cay is a sought after community with a major luxury development being created on the island. The island is approximately 6.5 miles long and 1,000 feet at its widest point. Norman's Cay features a 4,700 sq. ft. runway with customs and immigration. There is a large protected marina that can host an entire range of boat sizes. In addition, there is a yacht club and restaurant being created in addition to McDuff's restaurant and cottages, a well known restaurant and bar.

The island is located at the northern end of the exquisite Exuma Cays. With a quick 20 minute flight from Nassau, you will find yourself feeling worlds away surrounded by indigo seas, white powdery beaches, and a seemingly endless array of islands and empty beaches to explore.

Due to the limited supply of property on the island, this lot will not last long.",F2131306437,XS11619,,,Land,,"['Furnished', 'Island', 'Pets Allowed', 'View', 'Generator', 'Children Allowed', 'R/O Water Treatment']","LOT DESCRIPTION
